/*
Suppose we number the bytes in a w-bit word from 0 (least  significant) to w/8 â€“ 1 (most significant).
Write code for the  following C function, which will return an unsigned value 
in which byte i of argument x has been replaced by byte b:  

unsigned replace_byte(unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b);

Here are some examples showing how the function should work:

replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB) --> 0x12AB5678
replace_byte(0x12345678, 0, 0xAB) --> 0x123456AB

*/

#include <stdio.h>

unsigned replace_byte(unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b) {
    int offset = i << 3;
    return x & ~(0xff << offset) | b << offset;
}

void main() {
    printf("%X\n", replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB));
    printf("%X\n", replace_byte(0x12345678, 0, 0xAB));
}
